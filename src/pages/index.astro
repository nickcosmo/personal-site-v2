        Hi, I’m Nick! A software engineer and web developer based in Portland,
        OR. I specialize in the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystem and I’m
        passionate about building products and features that solve hard problems
        and enhance user experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        With over 3 years of hands-on experience, I’ve built and shipped
        production-grade applications that serve real users. I’m fluent in
        modern technologies and I enjoy collaborating with teams to turn ideas
        into robust digital products.
      </p>
      <p>
        I see programming as a creative craft, where problem solving meets
        creative thinking. Whether I’m architecting APIs or tweaking UI
        interactions, I find joy in solving problems and overcoming challenges
        with code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of coding, you’ll usually find me skateboarding, eating pizza,
        playing soccer, or watching a movie.
